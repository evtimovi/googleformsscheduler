A quick hack to sync sign ups from a form to my personal Google calendar and a publicly available spreadsheet

I wrote this when I needed to have residents sign up for an appointment with me. This syncs answers from a Google form to a spreadsheet representing the free times I had in that week and to my personal calendar.

There are better solutions to this problem, but I used this opportunity to learn about Google Doc scripts.

The connections to the spreadsheet and the form are hardcoded, so it is not directly usable in a new application.
